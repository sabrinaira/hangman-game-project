## Technical Features

We went through a multitude of obstacles to achieve making this game using pure JavaScript methods:

- __Generating random words__: We first initialized an array of a few words to start with which will be used during the gamepaly. Then we created a callback function that will help split any word into its own array of letters that will be utilized as the player proceeds to playing the game.

- __Hangman Stages__: The hangman starts appearing after the first incorrect guess. Hangman stages are in an array that is triggered based on the user's input. A counter variable is used to iterate the hangman stages from the first to last index.

- __Replayibility__: Player will have plenty of chances to play the game again every time they complete a word.
